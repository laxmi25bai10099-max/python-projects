Colleges need a simple way to store student marks and calculate results.
Many colleges store student marks manually or across multiple files.
This makes it difficult to maintain records, calculate results, and retrieve information quickly.
The Student Result Management System solves this problem by providing a simple python-based tool where you can add student details, update marks, calculate results, and store everything in a single csv file.
It ensures that all data stays organized, easy to access, and safely stored.

-The system automatically calculates total marks,percentage and grade.
-This makes result management easier,faster, and more accurate

##Target users
-Teacher who want to store marks easily and manage student results.
